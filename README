Candelabra is a browser-based time tracker capabable of tracking time on
multiple projects and providing for quick switching between which timer
is running.

It is a single HTML file (using hosted versions of jQuery and Bootstrap)
that uses localStorage for persisting logs between browser refreshes but
it is not intended for long-running time recording. The expected use case
is that times would be logged to some other system occasionally and cleared
from Candelabra.

For maximum enjoyment, make your browser as narrow as psosible and turn off
as much chrome as you can (toolbar, status bar, etc).

As of version 0.1, Candelabra has been tested on Safari and Chrome.
